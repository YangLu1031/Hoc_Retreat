			<p>Bio: </p>

			Tung began attending SCAC late in his high school years. He embraced Christ in 1991 and was baptized in 1996. He has always had a passion to see young people embrace and follow hard after Jesus. Tung began serving the youth as a counselor in the high school fellowship, New Life, before attending seminary at Multnomah University. In 2005, he returned as the youth pastor for the English congregation. In his spare time, he loves hanging out with his beautiful wife, Julie, watching good movies, reading books, and playing tennis.  Tung is very excited and honored to seek God together with you this weekend

			<p>“...[I] believe that the greatest motivation for evangelism...is for Christians to possess and embody a passionate, authentic, and holy love for Jesus Christ. A Christian embracing that intimacy and reality in Christ will not have to be pushed...into sharing his or her faith. The only way to stop such a follower of Christ is to kill them, and that would be gain.” You can learn more about Chip on his website: www.chipkirk.com
