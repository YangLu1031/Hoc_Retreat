					<p><u>WORKSHOP ON STUDYING & TEACHING GOD’S WORD</u><br>
		<p>PART ONE-“STUDYING GOD’S WORD” <br>
Before anyone can adequately teach God’s Word, he or she must learn how to interpret God’s Word. This is a process of discovery wherein students  inductively looks at the essential principles that God gave to the biblical author in ancient days, and now determine what principles are intended for the audience of today as transferable teachings from God.  This workshop will introduce students to the most effective methods for understanding the main idea and principles of God’s Word to prepare to teach the Bible.
                    <p>PART TWO-“TEACHING GOD’S WORD”<br>
The art of studying God’s Word is the discovery of the main idea and the transferable principles of the text. In order for the text to be taught, the main idea and biblical principles must be synthesized into a lesson plan.  This will aid students in learning what God was teaching during the ancient times, but also is relevant for learning and living godly lives today. This workshop will introduce students to the most effective methods for teaching God’s Word.

	        	    <p><u>Understanding Self(Workshop at 3:30-5:00p.m. on Friday, 8/7/15)</u><br/>
Being understood is a lifelong
yearning for every human being. Yet for many reasons, we
may not understand and communicate who we really are. As dynamic, God designed
human beings, we are shaped by our environment, family of origin,
relationships and life
experiences. Using examples of Matthew and others (Matthew 9:9; 1:117),
find out who you
are in the eyes of God. Understand yourself better by identifying past life events that led you
to who you (and others) think you are today. Good News: You don’t have to be stuck there!</p>

<p><u>Dealing with Feelings (Workshop #1 at 10:15-11:15 a.m. Saturday, 8/8/15)</u><br/>
Each family must face all kinds of pressure. For families with members immigrated to the
United States from overseas, there are additional cultural, language, and other factors that
affect their family dynamic and interactions. How could individuals in a multiethnic,
multicultural,
and multigenerational
family help themselves and one another to understand
emotions and deal with feelings so that they could meet the needs of each other and live in
intimate loving connection by God’s design? What can we learn from King David, the man
after God's own heart, when he was depressed (Psalm 13)?</p>

<p><u>Help! Nobody is Listening! (Workshop #2 and #3 at 1:00-3:00 p.m. Saturday, 8/8/15)</u>
Are you frustrated that conversations with your spouse, parents and children seem to be going
nowhere? Examine interactive styles and patterns that make or break communications.
Explore key elements of twoway
sharing according to James 1:19 in order to (re)
build and
deepen relationships while promoting personal awareness and growth. Learn how to listen so
that others will talk, and how to talk so that they will listen. Mandarinspeaking
parents are
invited to dialog and learn with their youth.</p>
<p><u>Q&A Session in Mandarin for Parents (3:30-5:
00 p.m. on Saturday, 8/8/15)</u><br/>
Questions and Answers for Mandarin Speaking
parents to process and apply the learning.
Further explore parental goals and expectation, cultural impacts, value system and other
paradigm shifts that will help parents to get along with, enjoy, and influence their ABC
children for the long haul.</p>

	                <p>Luke Tsai is currently the director of English Ministry at HOC1, where he calls his home church since 

1997. His passion is to help churches meet the needs of the current generation and help believers 

understand and apply the Bible. To this end, he put himself through rigorous training at Dallas 

Theological Seminary, where he received his Master of Theology in 2009 and is expected to earn his PhD 

in New Testament Studies this year.  </p>

<p>Prior to seminary, Luke served thirteen years in youth ministry as a youth counselor and devoted himself 

to teaching Sunday school classes of all ages. Professionally, Luke worked fifteen years as a digital circuit 

designer at Advanced Micro Devices. He holds a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 

from UC Berkeley and M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford. Luke and Jackie, his wife of fourteen 

years, have two daughters, Dorothy, 13, and Susannah 10.</p>

	                <p><u>Addressing Today’s Challenges Towards the Bible</u><br/>

The Bible has undergone increasing criticism and attack in the recent years. The university traditionally 

has been the fertile ground for open attacks on the Bible, where a good percentage of those who grow 

up in the church begin to question, even toss aside altogether, their faith. Today, serious challenge 

begins as early as high school. While unavoidable, some challenges and objections are, however, “self-

inflicted”—by how Christians mishandle the Bible. Many believers today continue to ignore figurative 

and symbolic language of the Bible, read their own theology into the Bible, and make the Bible say what 

it never intends to say. Christians who build their faith on a faulty view of the Bible put their faith in 

jeopardy and give the world a reason to discredit Christianity. What are the ways you might be 

mishandling the Bible? What are some of the practical ways you can begin to read the Bible responsibly 

so as to remove unnecessary conflicts with today’s world? These are the two main topics that this 

workshop will address. This workshop will help you develop a proper view of the Bible and fend off 

potential challenges to your faith.</p>
